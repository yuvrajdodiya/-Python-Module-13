• Understanding data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.

        data type : data type which is represent differnt type of value 

        integers:  Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
        floats :   Represents real numbers or numbers with a fractional part.
        strings:   strings is a squence of charactor 
        lists::    A list is like a box where you can keep a collection of items You can change the items in the list later.
        tuples:    A tuple is similar to a list, but once you put items inside a tuple, you can't change them.
        dictionaries: A dictionary is like a phone book where each item has a name (key) and a value 
        set:       A set is like a collection of unique items, meaning it doesn't allow duplicates.


• Python variables and memory allocation.
    
        python variables : variable is name which can store a value
    
        python memory allocation: 
            dynamic memory: Python objects like integers, strings, lists, etc. are
                            stored in the heap.
            Stack Memory:   Local variables like a function arguments and
                            function calls are managed in the stack.


• Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise

        operator: specific symbol to perfrom specific opreation.

        arithmetic operators : 
                    + ,- ,* , / , // (floor division) , **(exponention)

        comparison operator(relation operator) :
                    ==
                    !=
                    >
                    <
                    >=
                    <= 
        logical operator : 

                and (one condition true and second condition are fales)
                or (both condition are true )
                not (condition is fales)

        bitwise operator: 

            And(&)
            left shift(<<)
            right shift(>>)
            or(|)
            not(~)
